<h3> Plasma Thrusters </h3>
<p>
NPE has developed a series of models of arcjet thrusters and hybrid multi-stage thrusters combing
arcjet stage with Hall thruster and MPD thruster stages. The vacuum cathodic arc thruster with
evaporative copper cathode, 5mm in diameter, in external longitudinal magnetic field, is shown in
operation in the video opposite.

<h3> Plasma Actuators </h3>
NPE has developed a series of models of plasma actuators, which allow optimization of airflow around high altitude supersonic vehicles. The plasma cloud formed by remote arc discharge plasma stream is surrounding the body of the vehicle improving its aerodynamics in a controllable manner and also reduces the radar cross-section of the vehicle.
