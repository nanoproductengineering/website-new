        NPE’s latest advances in PVD technology are hybrid coating processes utilizing the synergetic combination of LAFAD™ sources and magnetrons or electron beam sources in

        a one universal vacuum chamber layout. This type of hybrid surface engineering systems is capable of deposition of large variety of coating compositions and architectures.

        The unique Filtered Arc Assisted Magnetron Sputtering (FAAMS™) process developed by Nano-Product Engineering, LLC offers the opportunity for significant improvement in

        performance of surface engineered components by addressing critical issues of coating microstructure and interface integrity. The hybrid FAAMS™ surface engineering system is

        shown schematically in Figure 4. The design of this modular hybrid PVD surface engineering equipment consists of two powerful LAFAD™ plasma sources in combination with

        conventional unbalanced magnetrons (UBM), either planar or rotary, all of which are integrated into one universal coating chamber layout, as illustrated schematically in Figure 4.

        This design layout enables the evaporation of different ceramic and metals in a highly ionized vapor plasma immersion environment. FAAMS™ technology is capable of depositing

        nano-structured coatings having functionally graded or multiple-layer architectures. These coatings are characterized by improved adhesion and toughness, and noted for their

        smoothness and structural integrity. FAAMS™ can also provide plasma immersion thermal-chemical treatment of substrates (ionitriding, carbonitriding, carburizing). Combinations

        of thermal-chemical treatments (e.g. ionitriding) followed by coating deposition (duplex process) can be accomplished in a single vacuum cycle. FAAMS™ process results in

        improved adhesive and cohesive toughness, reduced coating residual stresses, and allows deposition of relatively thick and extremely hard cermet coatings such as BCN, TiB2, and

        B4C, which would otherwise be impossible due to high residual stress adhesion failures.
