    <h1> About us </h1>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Nano-Product Engineering, LLC is an R&amp;D and transfer/commercialization company specializing in advanced surface engineering techniques to enhance material properties for a wide variety of applications.
      
      Founded in January, 2006, NPE is a small company in Lafayette, CO. NPE represents the culmination of work starting at Arcomac Plasma Processing Lab in Toronto, Canada and continuing at Arcomac Surface Engineering, LLC in Missoula, MT over a period of years from 1994 through 2010. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Our techniques include patented hybrid Physical Vapor Deposition and Plasma-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (PVD and PACVD) processes, which result in high density, low defect thin film coatings with uniform large-area coverage at industrial-scale production.
      Coatings are specifically developed for applications ranging from wear and corrosion resistance to optics, semiconductors and fuel cell systems.     
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Proven applications include: superhard and corrosion resistant coatings for medical instruments; low-friction, wear resistance coatings for gears and bearing races; erosion resistant coatings for compressor and rotor blades; high temperature oxidation resistant and conductive coatings for fuel cells and diamond and related materials superhard coatings for tools, machine parts and powder synthesis.  
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      NPE is pursuing the commercialization of patented and proprietary technologies in:
