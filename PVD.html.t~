The LAFAD TM and FAAMS TM unidirectional dual filtered cathodic arc deposition metal vapor plasma sources

are designed to meet the diverse needs of our customers, either retrofitting with existing PVD chambers, or

as a source component within advanced surface engineering equipment. The LAFAD TM and FAAMS TM sources

are available in two basic designs: one with straight end opening welded to the chamber wall; and another

with regular flange and Viton O-ring seal. Source control modules are provided, and can be easily integrated

into vacuum system controls.

NPE’s DCAD, LAFAD TM and FAAMS TM metal vapor plasma sources can be integrated into existing PVD systems,

or installed as primary sources for stand-alone systems. The LAFAD plasma sources can be integrated into

different chamber layouts. NPE and its predecessors have built a number of different batch coaters utilizing

one and two LAFAD sources as well as hybrid filtered arc assisted magnetron sputtering systems. NPE has

developed, constructed and sold several systems based upon advanced DCAD, LAFAD TM and FAAMS TM

technologies. The first model of NPE’s LAFAD-500C- 1 batch coater utilize one LAFAD-500C dual

unidirectional plasma source and two direct cathodic arc sources in one chamber layout. This system has a

carousel multi-satellites substrate table with coating area 16” dia x 12” tall.

NPE provides comprehensive source installation and technical support!

DCAD-350C is tubular source with circular cross-section with exit flange ISO-350mm for attachment to

vacuum chambers and plasma ducts. It utilizes the cone billet target 3” dia x 2” height.
