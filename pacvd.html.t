    <h4> Large area diamond coatings </h4>
    <p>
      NPE has developed a series of large area arc plasma reactors for PACVD processes, including process for diamond coatings, with deposition areas up to several sq. meters, operating pressures 1 mTorr to 100 Torr, and deposition rates of diamond films ranging from 1 to 30 Âµm/hr. 
    </p>
    <h4> Diamond coatings on ceramic powders </h4>
    <p>
      In addition to large area diamond processes, NPE has developed reactors for processing ceramic powders. These reactors, with dimensions measured in meters, can process multi-kilogram loads of ceramic powders, producing product powders with core-shell particles ranging from the nanometer to the millimeter scale.
