<h3> Plasma-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition </h3>
<div class="col-sm-6 text-justify">
<p>
NPE has developed a series of large area arc plasma reactors for PACVD processes including
deposition of diamond coatings. These reactors have deposition area up to several sq. meters and
operate in the pressure range 1 mTorr to 100 Torr. The deposition rate of diamond films in NPE
PACVD reactors is ranging from 1 to 30 Âµm/hr. In one embodiment of the diamond PACVD reactor
the substrates to be coated are suspended within the arc plasma cloud as shown in the video opposite, which details the diamond
PACVD process of plasma immersed cutting inserts.
