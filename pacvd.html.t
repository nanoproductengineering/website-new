<p>
NPE has developed a series of large area arc plasma reactors
for PACVD processes including deposition of diamond
coatings. These reactors have deposition area up to several
sq. meters and operate in the pressure range 1 mTorr to 100
Torr. The deposition rate of diamond films in NPE PACVD
reactors is ranging from 1 to 30 Âµm/hr. In one embodiment of
the diamond PACVD reactor the substrates to be coated are
suspended within the arc plasma cloud as shown in the image opposite.
